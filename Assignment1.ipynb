        "Q1: What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "A1: Python is a programming language developed by Guido van Rossum. It is a   versatile, general-purpose language used for website and software development, task automation, data analysis, and data visualisation.\n",
        "It is popular because of the following reasons:\n",
        "a). It has a simple syntax that mimics natural language, so it’s easier to read and understand. This makes it quicker to build projects and faster to improve on them.\n",
        "b). It is versatile. Python can be used for many different tasks, from web development to machine learning.\n",
        "c). It is beginner-friendly, making it popular for entry-level coders.\n",
        "d). It is open source, which means it is free to use and distribute, even for commercial purposes.\n",
        "e). Python’s archive of modules and libraries—bundles of code that third-party users have created to expand Python’s capabilities—is vast and growing.\n",
        "f). Python has a large and active community that contributes to Python’s pool of modules and libraries and acts as a helpful resource for other programmers.\n",

        "Q2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "A2. A Python interpreter is a program that converts Python code into machine-readable instructions and runs them, enabling us to execute Python scripts and view results instantly. It acts as a bridge between the high-level Python code we write and the low-level instructions that the computer can directly utilize.\n",

        "Q3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "A3. Pre-defined keywords in Python are special, reserved words that have specific meanings and functionalities within the language. These are case sensitive that can't be redefined in the code.They cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names, class names) in the code. For eg., for, while, if-elif-else, etc.\n",

        "A5. Mutable objects are those whose values can be changed in place after creation. This means you can alter their contents without creating a new object in memory. Examples of mutable types in Python include:\n",
        "Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, etc.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        "A6. Lists(mutable) are designed to be dynamic, allowing for flexibility in data manipulation. They have built-in methods like append(), insert(), etc to modify it's contents in place.\n",
        "Tuples(immutable) are intended to represent fixed collections of data. They don't have methods to modify their elements directly. Attempting to change a tuple's elements will result in an error.\n",

        "It determines if the values of two objects are the same.For eg:, list1 == list2 would be True if both lists contain the same elements in the same order.\n",
        "Identity operator:\"is\"\n",
        "This operator checks for object identity. It determines if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory.\n",

        "1.) and operator:\n",
        "It returns True if both operands are True and returns False if at least one operand is False.\n",
        "2.) or operator:\n",
        "It returns True if at least one operand is True and returns False if both operands are False.\n",
        "3.) not operator:\n",
        "A unary operator that reverses the Boolean value of its operand.\n",

        "Q9. What is type casting in Python\n",
        "A9. Type casting or type conversion, is the process of converting a variable or value from one data type to another. This can be done explicitly (by  programmer) or implicitly (by interpreter).\n",
        "For eg., .int(), .float(), etc change the values to integers and float respectively.\n",

        "A10. Explicit Type Casting:\n",
        "This involves manually converting a data type using built-in functions specific to the target type. Common functions include:\n",
        "int(), float(), list(), dict(), etc\n",
        "Implicit Type Casting:\n",
        "This occurs automatically when the Python interpreter converts data types to avoid errors during operations involving different types.\n",
        "Example: When adding an integer and a float, the integer is implicitly converted to a float before the addition.\n",

        "\n",
        "6. Reusability:\n",
        "Well-defined data structures can be reused across different parts of a program or even in different programs, promoting modularity and reducing development time.\n",

        "Immutable data types are those whose values cannot be changed or altered once they have been created. Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object actually results in the creation of a new object with the modified value, while the original object remains unchanged. Eg:, Strings.\n",

        "A6. In Python, a string is an immutable sequence of characters, used to represent text. Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes. Once a string is created, its individual characters cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string, like concatenation or slicing, actually creates a new string in memory.\n",
        "A list, on the other hand, is a mutable, ordered sequence of items. Lists are enclosed in square brackets ([...]) and can contain elements of different data types (integers, floats, strings, even other lists). Unlike strings, lists can be modified after creation by adding, removing, or changing elements at specific positions.\n",

        "**Q7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python **\n",
        "A7: Since tuples are immutable they provide a strong guarantee against accidental or unintended modification of the data it contains. This helps to ensure consistency.Because tuples are immutable, their hash value remains constant. This allows them to be used as keys in dictionaries\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python**\n",
        "A8.The fundamental mechanism behind dictionary storage involves hash tables. When a key-value pair is added to a dictionary:\n",
        "**1. Hashing the Key:**\n",
        "A hash function calculates a numerical \"hash\" value from the key. This hash value is an integer that ideally represents the key uniquely.\n",
        "**2. Determining Storage Location:**\n",
        "The hash value is then used to determine an index within an underlying array or list, which serves as the primary storage for the hash table. This often involves a modulo operation (hash % array\\_size) to ensure the index falls within the bounds of the array.\n",
        "**3. Storing the Pair:**\n",
        "The key-value pair, or a reference to it, is stored at the calculated index in the underlying array.\n",
        "When a value needs to be retrieved using its key:\n",
        "**1. Re-hashing the Key:** The same hash function is applied to the key to re-calculate its hash value.\n",
        "**2. Locating the Index:** The hash value is used to find the corresponding index in the underlying array, similar to the storage process.\n",
        "**3. Retrieving the Value:** The value associated with the key at that index is then retrieved.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q9. Can lists contain different data types in Python**\n",
        "A9. Yes, Python lists can contain elements of different data types.\n",
        "Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.They are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Lists are created using square brackets:\n",
        "2. List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.\n",
        "3. List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a single Python list can hold integers, floats, strings, booleans, and even other complex data structures like nested lists, tuples, or dictionaries, all within the same list.\n",
        "Here is an example demonstrating this:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_heterogeneous_list = [10, \"hello\", 3.14, True, [1, 2], {\"key\": \"value\"}]\n",

        "\n",
        "**Q10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python**\n",
        "A10. Strings in Python are \"immutable\" which means they can not be changed after they are created. Some other immutable data types are integers, float, boolean, etc.\n",
        "The immutability of Python string is very useful as it helps in hashing, performance optimization, safety, ease of use, optimize memory usage, reduces bugs, etc.\n",

        "**Q11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks**\n",
        "A11. Dictionaries offer several advantages over lists for certain tasks due to their ability to store and retrieve data based on unique keys, making them ideal for scenarios requiring fast lookups and data mapping.\n",
        "**Advantages of Dictionaries:**\n",
        "**Faster Lookups:**\n",
        "Dictionaries use hash tables for efficient key-based lookups, allowing for near constant-time (O(1)) retrieval of values, whereas lists require traversing the list to find a specific element (O(n)).\n",
        "**Key-Value Association:**\n",
        "Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, making it easy to associate related data and access it using descriptive keys. This is particularly useful for mapping relationships between items.\n",
        "**Dynamic Structure:**\n",
        "Dictionaries are mutable, allowing for the addition, modification, or removal of key-value pairs as needed, providing flexibility in managing data.\n",
        "**Suitable for Large Datasets:**\n",
        "Due to their efficient data retrieval, dictionaries are well-suited for storing and accessing large amounts of data quickly.\n",
        "**Examples of When Dictionaries are Preferred:**\n",
        "**Storing phone numbers:**\n",
        "Instead of a list of name-number pairs, a dictionary can map names to phone numbers for quick lookups.\n",
        "**Caching frequently accessed data:**\n",
        "Dictionaries can store frequently accessed data with unique identifiers (keys) for fast retrieval.\n",
        "**Implementing databases:**\n",
        "Dictionaries can be used to store and retrieve data records using unique IDs.\n",
        "**Representing complex data structures:**\n",
        "Dictionaries can be nested to represent hierarchical data with key-value relationships.\n",
        "**When Lists are More Suitable:**\n",
        "**Ordered sequences:**\n",
        "Lists are ideal when the order of elements is important and needs to be maintained.\n",
        "**Simple data storage:**\n",
        "For simple, unordered data, lists are sufficient and more memory-efficient than dictionaries.\n",
        "**Sequential processing:**\n",
        "Lists are faster for operations like appending, extending, and iterating through elements in a sequence.  \n",
