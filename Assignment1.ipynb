        "Q1: What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "A1: Python is a programming language developed by Guido van Rossum. It is a   versatile, general-purpose language used for website and software development, task automation, data analysis, and data visualisation.\n",
        "It is popular because of the following reasons:\n",
        "a). It has a simple syntax that mimics natural language, so it’s easier to read and understand. This makes it quicker to build projects and faster to improve on them.\n",
        "b). It is versatile. Python can be used for many different tasks, from web development to machine learning.\n",
        "c). It is beginner-friendly, making it popular for entry-level coders.\n",
        "d). It is open source, which means it is free to use and distribute, even for commercial purposes.\n",
        "e). Python’s archive of modules and libraries—bundles of code that third-party users have created to expand Python’s capabilities—is vast and growing.\n",
        "f). Python has a large and active community that contributes to Python’s pool of modules and libraries and acts as a helpful resource for other programmers.\n",

        "Q2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "A2. A Python interpreter is a program that converts Python code into machine-readable instructions and runs them, enabling us to execute Python scripts and view results instantly. It acts as a bridge between the high-level Python code we write and the low-level instructions that the computer can directly utilize.\n",

        "Q3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "A3. Pre-defined keywords in Python are special, reserved words that have specific meanings and functionalities within the language. These are case sensitive that can't be redefined in the code.They cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names, class names) in the code. For eg., for, while, if-elif-else, etc.\n",

        "\n",

        "Q4. Can keywords be used as variable names\n",
        "A4. No. Keywords are used to control program flow (e.g., if, else, for, while), define functions (def), handle exceptions (try, except), and more.\n",

        "A5. Mutable objects are those whose values can be changed in place after creation. This means you can alter their contents without creating a new object in memory. Examples of mutable types in Python include:\n",
        "Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, etc.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        "A6. Lists(mutable) are designed to be dynamic, allowing for flexibility in data manipulation. They have built-in methods like append(), insert(), etc to modify it's contents in place.\n",
        "Tuples(immutable) are intended to represent fixed collections of data. They don't have methods to modify their elements directly. Attempting to change a tuple's elements will result in an error.\n",

        "A7. Equality operator : \"==\"\n",
        "It determines if the values of two objects are the same.For eg:, list1 == list2 would be True if both lists contain the same elements in the same order.\n",
        "Identity operator:\"is\"\n",
        "This operator checks for object identity. It determines if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory.\n",

        "1.) and operator:\n",
        "It returns True if both operands are True and returns False if at least one operand is False.\n",
        "2.) or operator:\n",
        "It returns True if at least one operand is True and returns False if both operands are False.\n",
        "3.) not operator:\n",
        "A unary operator that reverses the Boolean value of its operand.\n",
        "If the operand is True, it returns False and if the operand is False, it will return True.\n",

        "Q9. What is type casting in Python\n",
        "A9. Type casting or type conversion, is the process of converting a variable or value from one data type to another. This can be done explicitly (by  programmer) or implicitly (by interpreter).\n",
        "For eg., .int(), .float(), etc change the values to integers and float respectively.\n",

        "A10. Explicit Type Casting:\n",
        "This involves manually converting a data type using built-in functions specific to the target type. Common functions include:\n",
        "int(), float(), list(), dict(), etc\n",
        "Implicit Type Casting:\n",
        "This occurs automatically when the Python interpreter converts data types to avoid errors during operations involving different types.\n",
        "Example: When adding an integer and a float, the integer is implicitly converted to a float before the addition.\n",

        "Conditional statements in Python are used to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. These statements help control the flow of a program.For eg:, if, elif, else.\n",
        "There output is in boolean TRUE or FALSE. Proper indentation has to be followed.\n",

        "elif statement allows for checking multiple conditions sequentially. If the if condition is False, the program checks the elif condition. Multiple elif statements can be used to handle various scenarios.\n",

        "A13.for loops are used when we know the number of iterations beforehand, while while loops are used when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition being met.\n",
        "For eg:, If we want to print the numbers from 1 to 5 usthen we will use a for loop\n",
        "for i in range(1, 6):\n",
        "    print(i)\n",
        " But if we want to print numbers starting from 1 and continues until it reaches a number less than 100, then we will use while\n",

        "A while situations where the number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on some dynamic condition. For eg, if i want to read data from a file Until EOF(end of file) then since the number of iterations are not fixed, we will use while loop.\n",
        "eg.2: When there are complex conditions or when the value of variables can change and we need to exit the loop early based on dynamic conditions that may change during execution we should use while loop.\n"
